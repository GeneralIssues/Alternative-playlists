**TODO:**

1: Fix the transition animation of the imageView containing the pictore of the current song
2: fix the initialization of the textView containing the song name in use
3: Set up an array containing the images to be displayed with the songs
4: Create the method to update the images accordingly
5: Fix boundaries for the different swipes
6: Make sure that the inner class MyAnimationListener is safe and maybe use some encapsulation
